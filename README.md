<p><em>Software Engineering student, graduated from #Henry's Botcamp in Full Stack Web Development, I am a developer with academic experience in teamwork, organized, problem-solving oriented, with high performance when learning new technologies, sociable and eager to carry out what is put in front of me.

Since I was a teenager I was attracted by computers and computer systems, from that age I entered the world of #linux, but it was until several years later that I decided to go deeper and found programming, hence I fell in love with this creative and challenging profession.

I have experience working with technologies such as #JavaScript, #HTML, #Css, #Sass, #React, #Node, #redux, #postgresql, #sequelize among others that I have learned in my career such as #C and #Java

Currently created two web projects individually applying all my knowledge in full stack. I also collaborated as a full stack developer in an ecommerce web project where products are marketed and services are offered to the client.

Currently I continue to delve deeper into the technologies that I already master since I am interested in offering quality in that company where I can add value.

I am looking for that company that allows me to give you the best of me and that at the same time offers me challenges where I can grow professionally.
